# Linear-Regression-Assignment-50-Startup-Dataset
This repository contains my linear regression assignment for Data Science. I've implemented a linear regression model in Python  to predict the target variable . The dataset used for training and testing the model is Kaggle 50-startup dataset. Feel free to explore the code and the results in the Jupyter Notebook provided.
